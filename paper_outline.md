# Multi-Agent SRTA: Solving XAI Evaluation Challenges Through Collaborative Assessment

## Abstract
- Problem: Individual researcher bias and evaluation instability in XAI assessment
- Solution: Three-agent collaborative evaluation system using Apertus LLM
- Results: Controlled differentiation (σ²=0.030), dataset recognition (p<0.001), agent specialization
- Impact: Addresses peer review concerns with reproducible, cost-effective methodology

## 1. Introduction
- XAI evaluation crisis (reference your first paper's findings)
- Individual researcher limitations
- Need for collaborative validation approaches

## 2. Related Work  
- Previous XAI evaluation methods and their limitations
- Multi-agent systems in evaluation
- Collaborative research methodologies

## 3. Multi-Agent SRTA Methodology
- Three agent roles: Principle, Expression, Audit
- Consensus weighting algorithm
- Apertus LLM integration for cost-effectiveness

## 4. Experimental Design
- 200-sample dataset from previous research
- Comparative analysis framework
- Statistical validation methods

## 5. Results
- Controlled score differentiation vs original instability
- Statistically significant dataset recognition
- Agent specialization validation (audit 0.49 points lower)

## 6. Discussion
- Direct response to peer review concerns
- Cost-effectiveness: $0 vs $100+ for comparable evaluation
- Scalability and reproducibility advantages

## 7. Conclusion
- Multi-agent approach solves individual researcher bias
- Provides controlled, meaningful evaluation differentiation
- Enables collaborative validation without massive resources
