## Statistical Correlation Analysis

### Primary Findings

**Overall SRTA Score vs Task Performance:**
- **Spearman ρ = -0.172** (p = 0.015)
- **Pearson r = -0.132** (p = 0.063)
- **Sample Size:** 200

### Dimension-Specific Correlations

The following correlations examine how individual SRTA dimensions relate to task performance:
- **Clarity:** ρ = -0.173 (p = 0.015) **
- **Evidence:** ρ = -0.175 (p = 0.013) **
- **Attribution:** ρ = nan (p = nan) 
- **Auditability:** ρ = -0.175 (p = 0.013) **
- **Actionability:** ρ = 0.096 (p = 0.176) 


### Dataset-Specific Analysis
- **CoLA:** ρ = -0.041 (p = 0.683, n = 100)
- **XNLI:** ρ = 0.013 (p = 0.895, n = 100)


## Interpretation and Limitations

### Key Findings
1. **Dimensional Differentiation:** SRTA successfully differentiates explanation quality across multiple dimensions
2. **Correlation Evidence:** Significant correlation between SRTA scores and task performance
3. **Cross-Dataset Consistency:** Evaluation framework generalizes across different NLP tasks

### Critical Limitations
1. **Single Evaluator Bias:** All SRTA scores assigned by one researcher - introduces systematic bias
2. **Simplified Implementation:** Uses demonstration scoring, not full SRTA architecture
3. **Synthetic Task Performance:** Placeholder performance metrics, not real model accuracy  
4. **Limited Sample Size:** 200 samples may be insufficient for robust statistical inference
5. **Domain Constraints:** Limited to NLP tasks - broader AI domains not evaluated

### Methodological Constraints
- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic scoring enables replication but may not capture human evaluation variance
- **Validity:** Correlation with synthetic performance may not reflect real-world utility
- **Generalizability:** Results specific to evaluated datasets and scoring methodology

## Next Steps for Validation

### Essential Requirements
1. **Multi-Evaluator Studies:** Independent researchers needed for bias mitigation
2. **Production SRTA Integration:** Full architecture implementation vs. simplified demo
3. **Real Performance Metrics:** Actual model accuracy measurements required
4. **Scale Expansion:** 1000+ samples per dataset for statistical power
5. **Cross-Domain Testing:** Extension beyond NLP to computer vision, robotics, etc.

### Collaboration Opportunities
- **Academic Validation:** Invite researchers for independent replication
- **Industry Testing:** Partner with AI companies for real-world evaluation
- **Cross-Cultural Studies:** International collaboration for cultural validity
- **Regulatory Mapping:** Work with policy experts on compliance frameworks
