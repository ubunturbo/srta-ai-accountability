Contributing to TMA-SRTA
Welcome to the TMA-SRTA (Three-Module Architecture for Self-Regulating Transparent AI) project!
We're building the world's first computational implementation of classical four-cause design patterns in modern AI systems. This is an interdisciplinary research project that bridges philosophy, computer science, and AI ethics.
🎯 Project Vision
TMA-SRTA represents a revolutionary approach to AI accountability through Structural Design Pattern Theory (SDPT). We're creating the first measurable implementation of Aristotelian four-cause design theory in over 2,400 years.
