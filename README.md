# SRTA: AI Explanation Evaluation Framework

⚠️ **Proof-of-Concept Architecture** - A research framework for systematic evaluation of AI explanations, combining quality assessment with responsibility tracking.

## Contribution Type

This repository presents a novel architectural approach to AI explanation accountability, demonstrating how responsibility tracking can be integrated with quality assessment. The implementation serves as a proof-of-concept for the theoretical framework rather than a validated production system.

## Architectural Innovation

- Integration of stakeholder attribution with explanation evaluation
- Multi-layer principle tracking (Authority, Interface, Integration modules)
- Structured accountability assessment alongside traditional quality metrics
- Proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating architectural feasibility

## Research Positioning

This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of responsibility-aware AI systems rather than claiming empirical validation. The focus is on architectural patterns and implementation feasibility, providing a foundation for future validation studies by researchers with appropriate resources.

## Theoretical Framework

This architecture addresses a gap in existing XAI approaches by integrating:
- **Formal responsibility attribution** alongside technical explanation quality
- **Multi-stakeholder principle tracking** for complex organizational contexts
- **Structured accountability assessment** complementing feature-importance analysis

The implementation demonstrates feasibility of these concepts rather than optimized performance.

## What SRTA Does

SRTA evaluates existing AI explanations by measuring both their quality and the level of responsibility information they contain. The system provides statistical analysis of how these two aspects correlate and offers recommendations for improvement.

**Core functionality:**
- Quality assessment: Measures clarity, completeness, and understandability of explanations
- Responsibility tracking: Evaluates presence of actor identification, decision traceability, and process transparency
- Correlation analysis: Analyzes statistical relationships between quality and responsibility metrics
- Pattern classification: Categorizes evaluation results into improvement patterns

## What SRTA Does Not Do

- Does not generate explanations (evaluates existing ones only)
- Does not provide legal compliance verification
- Does not include cryptographic audit trails or blockchain features
- Does not implement natural language processing or semantic analysis
- Does not guarantee regulatory compliance with EU AI Act or similar frameworks

## Usage Example

```python
from src.srta.evaluation.evaluation_layer import EvaluationLayer

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = EvaluationLayer()

# Evaluate an explanation with proper context format
test_context = {
    'explanation_text': 'The model classified this as high-risk based on detected features: credit history (weight: 0.4), income ratio (weight: 0.3), employment status (weight: 0.3).',
    'model_name': 'risk_classifier_v1',
    'domain': 'financial_services'
}

result = evaluator.evaluate_explanation(test_context)
print(f"Quality Level: {result.quality_level.value}")
print(f"Overall Score: {result.metrics.overall:.1%}")
```

## Installation and Testing

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.8+ recommended, Linux/macOS preferred

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ubunturbo/srta-ai-accountability.git
cd srta-ai-accountability
pip install -r requirements.txt
python working_test.py
```

## Current Limitations

- **Platform**: Windows compatibility may vary (tested primarily on Linux/macOS)
- **Scope**: Evaluation tool only, not a complete XAI solution
- **Scale**: Tested on limited scenarios, not validated on large datasets
- **Validation**: Research implementation with limited independent verification
- **Performance**: Proof-of-concept implementation, not optimized for production use

## Project Status

- **Current Phase**: Architectural proof-of-concept - functional but not production-ready
- **Last Updated**: September 2025
- **Academic Status**: Theoretical contribution, no peer-reviewed publications yet
- **Future Work**: Independent validation, expanded testing, community feedback integration
